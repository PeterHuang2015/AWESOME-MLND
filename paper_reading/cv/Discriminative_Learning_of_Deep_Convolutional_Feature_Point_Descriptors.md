## Abstract
Ambitious work, authors from different research groups cooperated to bring out a better Feature Point Descriptor in comparison with state-of-art algorithms. Using siamese network to train a vector that pull similar patches together and push different patches away.
Sampling method and loss function construction is important for the successing of the descriptor. Pretty tricky to train smaller network to perform this kind of task.
